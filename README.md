# **CNN-XGBoost Diagnostic Model for Malaria Detection in Microscopic Blood Parasite Images**
## **Overview**
Malaria, a life-threatening disease caused by plasmodium parasites and transmitted through mosquito bites, continues to pose a significant global health challenge. In this project, we propose an advanced machine learning approach to improve malaria detection. Our methodology integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier for image classification.

## **Project Description**
## **Data Collection**
We compiled a dataset of microscopic images of blood samples, categorized into two classes: parasitized (infected with malaria) and uninfected.

## **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**
To ensure the data was suitable for model training, we performed extensive preprocessing and augmentation, enhancing the quality and diversity of the training data.

## **Model Architecture**
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Utilized to automatically extract relevant features from the microscopic images, capturing intricate patterns that indicate malaria infection.
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): A robust and efficient classifier used to classify the images based on the features extracted by the CNN.

## **Training and Evaluation**
The combined model was rigorously trained on labeled data and subsequently evaluated on a separate validation set to assess its performance metrics. Our approach showed promising results in accurately distinguishing between parasitized and uninfected samples.

## **Key Features**
### Accurate Detection:
High accuracy in distinguishing between parasitized and uninfected blood samples.
### Advanced Machine Learning Techniques: 
Utilizes CNNs for feature extraction and XGBoost for classification.
### Efficient Processing: 
Robust and efficient classification, suitable for real-time diagnostic applications.
### Early Diagnosis: 
Facilitates early detection and intervention in malaria-endemic regions.
